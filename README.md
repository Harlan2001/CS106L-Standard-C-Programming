# CS106L : Standard C++ programming

This course will delve into many standard C++ features and syntax, allowing students to write high quality C++ code.For example, auto binding, uniform initialization, lambda function, move semantics, RAII and other skills are very practical.

It is worth mentioning that the assignment for this course implements a HashMap (similar to the unordered_map in the STL), which almost ties the whole course together and is very testing of the code.Especially the implementation of iterator. After this assignment I began to understand why Linus was so sniffed at C/C++ because it was really hard to write correctly.

Generally speaking, this course is not difficult, but it has a lot of information, which needs to be repeatedly consolidated in the future development practice.
